Asalamualykum (means peace be upon you), it's good to hear you have accepted islam. 
Congratulations on being blessed with guidance, and I ask Allah to only increase you in guidance.

I want to let you know that now you have become a muslim, you are just as much of a muslim as anyone else. 
No one is allowed to tell you that you are less of a muslim based on your skin colour or on the amount of time you have been a muslim. 

"O people, your Lord is one and your father Adam is one. T
here is no favor of an Arab over a foreigner, nor a foreigner over an Arab, 
and neither white skin over black skin, nor black skin over white skin, except by righteousness.
 Have I not delivered the message?" - The prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

No doubt there's a lot to learn, but that's true for all muslims all the time. You should learn firstly about the five pillars. They are: belief/testimony, prayer, zakaat (a type of charity), fasting, hajj (pilgrimage to the building called the kaabah in makkah, saudi arabia).

Below I will attach some resources I recommend so you can learn more. Feel free also to contact me on whatsapp.

https://islamqa.info/en - a website that releases many islamic rulings on various topics. there's a lot of good information here. if you ever have a question and don't know who to ask / can't find anyone to ask then this should suffice.
